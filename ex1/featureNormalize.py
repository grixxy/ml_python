% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: First, for each feature dimension, compute the mean
%               of the feature and subtract it from the dataset,
%               storing the mean value in mu. Next, compute the
%               standard deviation of each feature and divide
%               each feature by it's standard deviation, storing
%               the standard deviation in sigma.
%
%               Note that X is a matrix where each column is a
%               feature and each row is an example. You need
%               to perform the normalization separately for
%               each feature.
%
% Hint: You might find the 'mean' and 'std' functions useful.
